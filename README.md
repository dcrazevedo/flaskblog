# flaskblog

**A blog built in Flask. It is a reproduction with some modifications of @coreyMSchafer Youtube Playlist.**

The APP Factory was modified so it becomes more clean. I took the advantade of @rochabruno's idea for Dynaconf and changed some files and directories.

This project is for educational purpose ans it is free for collaboration. Some tasks are still in construction: 

1. html files are poorly designed.
2. postgresql should be used instead of sqlite
3. Thinking on using Dynaconf to avoid app (or current_app) imports.
4. Add general funcionalities as 'like', 'dislike', 'share'...
